# Chrome-extension
I wanted to publish this code as a chrome extension I built. It is for bookmarking a site.
Just download the zip file and extract it. Then go to "chrome://extensions/" and turn on developer mode. Then click on "Load Unpacked" to deploy it.
(This project was done with the help of scrimba).
Feel free to improve the code if u want to.
